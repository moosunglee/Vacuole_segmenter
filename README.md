# Vacuole_segmenter

The repository includes a main architecture of the neural network used in 
"Hybrid machine-learning framework for volumetric segmentation and quantification of vacuoles in individual unlabeled yeast cells using holotomography" by Moosung Lee, Marina Kunzi et al..

The architecture was mainly adapted from a Korean Youtuber's tutorial for DNN: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBb597ct_FQ&list=PLqtXapA2WDqbE6ghoiEJIrmEnndQ7ouys&index=6"

The used dataset for the project is available in "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MQucnWap-SlW9sNcVOj6j-c2wckfVp6J?usp=sharing".
